# 42Cursus-libft

Description:

- Developed a custom C library, named "libft," as part of the 42 School curriculum. The library includes a broad range of essential functions, enabling standard C programming tasks without relying on external libraries. This project aimed to strengthen fundamental programming skills and understanding of data structures. And also it will be one of our main library sources to use in other projects.

Key Achievements:

- Implemented a diverse set of functions for string manipulation, memory management, and character handling.

- Designed reusable data structures such as linked lists and binary trees to enhance code modularity.

- Conducted extensive testing to ensure the reliability and efficiency of each function.

- Adhered to the school's norm and coding standards.

Technologies:

- C
